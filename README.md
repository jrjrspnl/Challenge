I've been watching some crashcourse videos on youTube before doing this task to refresh my knowledge in vanilla CSS and JavaScript. 
For this challenge, I struggled a bit with the JavaScript part, so I asked for help from AI (sorry po) to get the functionality workingâ€”I'm still learning it little by little.
As for CSS, I'm more comfortable using Tailwind since it makes it so much easier to build responsive websites.
